SeidorTest
============

This project uses CocoaPods. The external libraries used are:  

-  Alamofire
-  SwiftyJSON
-  SVProgressHUD

## Instructions

Just download the project and open the file `SeidorTest.xcworkspace`. No need to run `pod install` as the project already comes with the libraries.
Probably Xcode will ask you to change the Development team. After that you should not have any issues to run the project.

**Tested in Xcode Version 9.3 (9E145)
